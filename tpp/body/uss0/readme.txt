This has been superceeded by (and likely conflicts with) US soldiers body addon included in caplags US Naval Prison Facility.
But is still useful as a contained example of a soldier body addon.
Textures have been culled for space since it's no longer supposed to be a usuable mod.

Old readme:
'USS Soldier' IH body addon r1
(Requires Infinite Heaven r231+)
Model ported from GZ, new fv2s.

WARNING: Only uninstall body addons when save is at ACC / not while in any other mission or level.

Body addons add settings to 'Custom soldier type' and 'DD Suit' options which allow control of AI soldier appearance.
WARNING: Body fova addons have a limit of ~65 additions (for MGSVTPP 1.14), above this the body fovas will fail to apply and will default to the underlying body model.

Adds 'USS Soldier' body option.
This addon includes 4 body fova entries, which slightly contribute towards the body fova limit.
ISSUES:
Just really an example WIP for the body addon system at the moment:
Does not have skin tone support so dark skinned soldiers will still have light skinned hands. May be fixed if FoxKit gains full fv2 support.
Does not have visual 'enemy prep' equipment support (helmet,masks,armor).
No voice callouts in Africa.
