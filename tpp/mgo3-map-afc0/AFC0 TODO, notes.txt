AFC0 TODO, notes
GOTCHA: this repo requires the mgo chunk0 location/afc0 files as a base.

addon readme has simplified user facing todo


inter cp lrrp

location scripts

combat locators
	Not sure what's up with TppCombatLocatorData, hard to see if they do anything.

	ex \Assets\tpp\pack\mission2\free\f30010\f30010_fpkd
	\Assets\tpp\level\location\afgh\block_mission2\large\tent\combat\afgh_tent_combat_f01.fox2.xml"
	TppCombatLocatorSetData 
		refs multiple
		TppCombatLocatorData

	TppGuardTargetData - are these always active on alert?
		aimpoints
	whats the usual set up, only 1 per cp?
	with 2 aimpoints?

---
what fox2s have cps for free roam (or in general) and move afc0s cps to the equivalent
	in *_route.fox2 files - \f30020\f30020_fpkd\Assets\tpp\level\location\mafr\block_mission2\large\banana\route\mafr_banana_route_f01.fox2.xml
	or _npc fox2 files for mission specific

soundbanks:
start.lua SoundCoreDaemon.SetAssetPath"/Assets/mgo/sound/asset/" 
so even with game being able to read the coppied .dat will need to install sbp for the level to /Assets/tpp/sound/asset/
doesnt work without mgo init.bnk


bgmphase not being called?
TppPackList.AddMissionPack"/Assets/tpp/pack/mission2/ih/bgm_fob_ih.fpk" dont work


briefing_ob sometimes alerts village_cp at same time (approach the cp from the start), other times does not (go around side and the alert soldiers there)
