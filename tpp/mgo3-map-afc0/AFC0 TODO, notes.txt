AFC0 TODO, notes

readme todo, actual todo below that
TODO of incomplete, unordered and no indication of whether they will or can be done tasks:

locations ambient sound
doesnt work without mgo init.bnk 

bgm


TODO:
<location>_scripts

routes

combat locators


routes
	currently just have single point routes so soldiers dont move around outside of combat (apart from automatic conversations if they are near a buddy)
	also as there's no navmesh routes would need to lead around obstacles more carefully than normal
	havent put any thought

navmesh
	is the reason soldiers cant navigate properly when in alert 
	while a bunch of reversing has been done on it, I don't think there's been successful creation of nav meshes
	need help


TODO: test ih features support

|21:09:44:809|info: ResetObjectPool: wkr_WalkerGear_0001==NULL_ID
would need walker positions

parasite

inter cp lrrp



actual TODO
combat locators
	ex \Assets\tpp\pack\mission2\free\f30010\f30010_fpkd
	\Assets\tpp\level\location\afgh\block_mission2\large\tent\combat\afgh_tent_combat_f01.fox2.xml"
	TppCombatLocatorSetData 
		refs multiple
		TppCombatLocatorData

	TppGuardTargetData - are these always active on alert?
		aimpoints
	whats the usual set up, only 1 per cp?
	with 2 aimpoints?

---
what fox2s have cps for free roam (or in general) and move afc0s cps to the equivalent
	in *_route.fox2 files - \f30020\f30020_fpkd\Assets\tpp\level\location\mafr\block_mission2\large\banana\route\mafr_banana_route_f01.fox2.xml
	or _npc fox2 files for mission specific

soundbanks:
start.lua SoundCoreDaemon.SetAssetPath"/Assets/mgo/sound/asset/" 
so even with game being able to read the coppied .dat will need to install sbp for the level to /Assets/tpp/sound/asset/
doesnt work without mgo init.bnk


bgmphase not being called?
TppPackList.AddMissionPack"/Assets/tpp/pack/mission2/ih/bgm_fob_ih.fpk" dont work
