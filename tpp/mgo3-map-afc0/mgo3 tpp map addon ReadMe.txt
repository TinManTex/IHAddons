!!!!IMPORTANT STEP BEFORE INSTALLING THIS!!!!
Copy MGS_TPP\mgo\chunk0.dat to MGS_TPP\master\chunk5_mgo0.dat 
Copy MGS_TPP\mgo\texture0.dat to MGS_TPP\master\texture5_mgo0.dat

Only then install the .mgsv with SnakeBite

texture5_mgo0.dat may have already been transfered if you used Archive Transferrer tool (by following Us Naval Prison Facility addon installation), but chunk5_mgo0.dat is also required for this addon.


Just an initial release of ported MGO3 map for people to play around with.
Very alpha, only the minimal setup to have the map load and have sideops work.

Current major obstacle to making this a good playable location is the lack of navmeshes for AI/enemies to work correctly when in combat.

But the community could do with people with experience in reverse engineering or programming to help with tools.

Until then, if ever, sideops can still be created, see Addon mission sideop companion workaround.txt if you want to do something with Sideop Companion https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/571
